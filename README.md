🚴‍♂️ London Bike Shares – Power BI Dashboard Project



Welcome to my London Bike Shares Power BI project.



The goal of this project is to highlight my Power BI skills by building an engaging, intuitive dashboard that presents meaningful insights—even to viewers without a technical background.



This project demonstrates my ability to:

🎨 Design clean and visually appealing dashboards that tell a story through data.

🧠 Communicate insights clearly and interactively, helping users explore how weather, seasons, holidays, and weekends impact London’s bike rental trends.

🧹 Perform data cleaning and transformation directly within Power BI, preparing raw data for analysis.

🔢 Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures, perform complex calculations, and add depth to visualizations.


Whether you're a data enthusiast or a first-time viewer, this project is designed to be both insightful and accessible.
